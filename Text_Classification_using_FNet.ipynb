            "b'\"hollywood hotel\" has relationships to many films like \"ella cinders\" and \"merton of the movies\" about someone winning a contest including a contract to make films in hollywood, only to find the road to stardom either paved with pitfalls or non-existent. in fact, as i was watching it tonight, on turner classic movies, i was considering whether or not the authors of the later musical classic \"singing in the rain\" may have taken some of their ideas from \"hollywood hotel\", most notably a temperamental leading lady star in a movie studio and a conclusion concerning one person singing a film score while another person got the credit by mouthing along on screen.<br /><br />\"hollywood hotel\" is a fascinating example of movie making in the 1930s. among the supporting players is louella parsons, playing herself (and, despite some negative comments i\\'ve seen, she has a very ingratiating personality on screen and a natural command of her lines). she is not the only real person in the script. make-up specialist perc westmore briefly appears as himself to try to make one character resemble another.<br /><br />this film also was one of the first in the career of young mr. ronald reagan, playing a radio interviewer at a movie premiere. reagan actually does quite nicely in his brief scenes - particularly when he realizes that nobody dick powell is about to take over the microphone when it should be used with more important people.<br /><br />dick powell has won a hollywood contract in a contest, and is leaving his job as a saxophonist in benny goodman\\'s band. the beginning of this film, by the way, is quite impressive, as the band drives in a parade of trucks to give a proper goodbye to powell. they end up singing \"hooray for hollywood\". the interesting thing about this wonderful number is that a lyric has been left out on purpose. throughout the johnny mercer lyrics are references to such hollywood as max factor the make-up king, rin tin tin, and even a hint of tarzan. but the original song lyric referred to looking like tyrone power. obviously jack warner and his brothers were not going to advertise the leading man of 20th century fox, and the name donald duck was substituted. in any event the number showed the singers and instrumentalists of goodman\\'s orchestra at their best. so did a later five minute section of the film, where the band is rehearsing.<br /><br />powell leaves the band and his girl friend (frances langford) and goes to hollywood, only to find he is a contract player (most likely for musicals involving saxophonists). he is met by allen joslyn, the publicist of the studio (the owner is grant mitchell). joslyn is not a bad fellow, but he is busy and he tends to slough off people unless it is necessary to speak to them. he parks powell at a room at the hollywood hotel, which is also where the studio\\'s temperamental star (lola lane) lives with her father (hugh herbert), her sister (mabel todd), and her sensible if cynical assistant (glenda farrell). lane is like jean hagen in \"singing in the rain\", except her speaking voice is good. her version of \"dan lockwood\" is one \"alexander dupre\" (alan mowbray, scene stealing with ease several times). the only difference is that mowbray is not a nice guy like gene kelly was, and lane (when not wrapped up in her ego) is fully aware of it. having a fit on being by-passed for an out-of-the ordinary role she wanted, she refuses to attend the premiere of her latest film. joslyn finds a double for her (lola\\'s real life sister rosemary lane), and rosemary is made up to play the star at the premiere and the follow-up party. but she attends with powell (joslyn wanting someone who doesn\\'t know the real lola). this leads to powell knocking down mowbray when the latter makes a pest of himself. but otherwise the evening is a success, and when the two are together they start finding each other attractive.<br /><br />the complications deal with lola coming back and slapping powell in the face, after mowbray complains he was attacked by powell (\"and his gang of hoodlums\"). powell\\'s contract is bought out. working with photographer turned agent ted healey (actually not too bad in this film - he even tries to do a jolson imitation at one point), the two try to find work, ending up as employees at a hamburger stand run by bad tempered edgar kennedy (the number of broken dishes and singing customers in the restaurant give edgar plenty of time to do his slow burns with gusto). eventually powell gets a \"break\" by being hired to be dupre\\'s singing voice in a rip-off of \"gone with the wind\". this leads to the final section of the film, when rosemary lane, herbert, and healey help give powell his chance to show it\\'s his voice, not mowbrays.<br /><br />it\\'s quite a cute and appealing film even now. the worst aspects are due to it\\'s time. several jokes concerning african-americans are no longer tolerable (while trying to photograph powell as he arrives in hollywood, healey accidentally photographs a porter, and mentions to joslyn to watch out, powell photographs too darkly - get the point?). also a bit with curt bois as a fashion designer for lola lane, who is (shall we say) too high strung is not very tolerable either. herbert\\'s \"hoo-hoo\"ing is a bit much (too much of the time) but it was really popular in 1937. and an incident where healey nearly gets into a brawl at the premiere (this was one of his last films) reminds people of the tragic, still mysterious end of the comedian in december 1937. but most of the film is quite good, and won\\'t disappoint the viewer in 2008.'\n",
            "1\n",
            "b'what starts out as a very predictable and somewhat drab affair is in the end quite hilarious and entertaining. \"right to die\" is not very suspenseful but it more than makes up for that with some outlandish set pieces and over the top gore.<br /><br />spoilers here: <br /><br />top credits also go to the dead-on performance from martin donovan as one of the most despicable characters ever to grace the screen. playing the character in a great \"aloof\" fashion, you nearly feel bad for the guy in the end when his grand plan ultimately fails. corbin bernsen also chews up the scenery playing a not-so-good-guy who gets his just desserts.<br /><br />end of spoiler.<br /><br />as a revenge-from-the-dead flick, \"right to die\" benefits heavily from it\\'s performers and is more than an ok way to spend less than an hour.'\n",
