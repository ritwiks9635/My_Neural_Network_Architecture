        "##**BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**\n",
        "\n",
        "In the field of computer vision, researchers have repeatedly shown the value of transfer learning — pretraining a neural network model on a known task/dataset, for instance ImageNet classification, and then performing fine-tuning — using the trained neural network as the basis of a new specific-purpose model. In recent years, researchers have shown that a similar technique can be useful in many natural language tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "BERT makes use of Transformer, an attention mechanism that learns contextual relations between words (or subwords) in a text. In its vanilla form, Transformer includes two separate mechanisms — an encoder that reads the text input and a decoder that produces a prediction for the task. Since BERT’s goal is to generate a language model, only the encoder mechanism is necessary. The detailed workings of Transformer are described in a paper by Google.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "As opposed to directional models, which read the text input sequentially (left-to-right or right-to-left), the Transformer encoder reads the entire sequence of words at once. Therefore it is considered bidirectional, though it would be more accurate to say that it’s non-directional. This characteristic allows the model to learn the context of a word based on all of its surroundings (left and right of the word).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "When training language models, a challenge is defining a prediction goal. Many models predict the next word in a sequence (e.g. \"The child came home from _\"), a directional approach which inherently limits context learning. To overcome this challenge, BERT uses two training strategies:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "###**Masked Language Modeling (MLM)**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Before feeding word sequences into BERT, 15% of the words in each sequence are replaced with a [MASK] token. The model then attempts to predict the original value of the masked words, based on the context provided by the other, non-masked, words in the sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "###**Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)**\n",
        "\n",
        "In the BERT training process, the model receives pairs of sentences as input and learns to predict if the second sentence in the pair is the subsequent sentence in the original document. During training, 50% of the inputs are a pair in which the second sentence is the subsequent sentence in the original document, while in the other 50% a random sentence from the corpus is chosen as the second sentence. The assumption is that the random sentence will represent a disconnect from the first sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Though Google provides a pretrained BERT checkpoint for English, you may often need to either pretrain the model from scratch for a different language, or do a continued-pretraining to fit the model to a new domain. In this notebook, we pretrain BERT from scratch optimizing both MLM and NSP objectves using 🤗 Transformers on the WikiText English dataset loaded from 🤗 Datasets."
